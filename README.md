i'm an introvert at heart, i don't approach anyone first - we could be the closets ever but i will still hesitate to approach you. the most you'll actually get from me is a boop in your direction or atabook signs. i also can't tell if i'm genuinely wanted somewhere which causes me to not interact first, so yah.

i struggle incredibly with conversations, not the best at starting them but definitely one of the worst at continuing them - i can joke around n stuff ( barely ), but actual convos is where i go deadbeat silent.

i can't tell tones that well, tone tags are nice but they don't help that much </3 much apricated if they're used tho.

sorry if i seem like a dick, going through a lot of things - on and off because of this.

literally jinx and jeff irl btw, akechi and futaba too..

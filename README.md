i'm an introvert at heart, i very rarely approach anyone first - we could be the closets ever but i will still hesitate to approach you. the most you'll actually get from me is a boop in your direction or atabook signs. i also can't tell if i'm genuinely wanted somewhere which causes me to not interact first, so yah.

i struggle incredibly with conversations, not the best at starting them but definitely one of the worst at continuing them - i can joke around n stuff, but actual convos is where i go deadbeat silent.

i can't tell tones that well, tone tags are nice but they don't help that much </3 much apricated if they're used tho.
